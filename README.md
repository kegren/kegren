## Hi, I'm Kenny Damgren 👋

Web developer based in Västerås, Sweden, building modern **JavaScript/TypeScript** apps with a strong focus on **React**, **TanStack**, and great DX.  
Earlier in my career I lived in the **PHP** world, working with **DDD**, **CQRS**, and **event sourcing** – that background still shapes how I think about domains, boundaries, and long‑term maintainability.

I enjoy turning real product ideas into working software – from polished UIs to well‑structured domains, APIs, and workflows that are easy to reason about and evolve.

---

### What I love building

- **TanStack ecosystem apps** – fullstack setups with TanStack Start, Router, Query, DB, and Form working together with React 19.2 + React Compiler.
- **Fullstack TypeScript apps** – from API design and data modeling to clean, fast UIs and dashboards.
- **E‑commerce & internal tools** – admin areas and custom backoffice tools that support real businesses.
- **AI‑flavored experiences** – thoughtful use of AI to improve UX and developer workflows, not just sprinkle buzzwords.
- **Nice developer experiences** – fast feedback loops, strong typing, and clear boundaries between domains.

### Tech stack

- **Core**: TypeScript · React 19.2 · React Compiler 1.0 · Bun  
- **TanStack**: Start · DB · Router · Query · Form · Devtools  
- **Backend & data**: PostgreSQL · Drizzle ORM · Better Auth · pg-boss · Resend  
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS v4 · shadcn/ui · Radix UI · Lucide  
- **Tooling & testing**: Vite · Vitest · Biome + Ultracite  
- **AI & automation**: Model‑driven workflows for faster iteration and exploration  
- **Background (PHP era)**: Custom e‑commerce systems · API integrations · DDD/CQRS/event‑sourced apps · small frameworks like [Sody](https://github.com/kegren/sody)

### Projects

- **tano-stack** – A TanStack Start starter that puts the TanStack ecosystem (Router, Query, Form, Devtools) front and center on Bun + React 19.2, with a modern UI and production‑ready structure.
- **Sody** – [A small, flexible PHP framework](https://github.com/kegren/sody) from my earlier PHP days – a good snapshot of how much I enjoy designing APIs and framework internals.
- **Kemero work** – Custom web and e‑commerce projects where I’ve helped clients go from idea to production with tailored solutions instead of one‑size‑fits‑all templates.

---

### How I like to work

- **Type‑safe by default** – strong TypeScript and schema validation instead of “hope it passes in production.”
- **Domain‑focused** – bringing DDD thinking (and, when it fits, CQRS/event sourcing) to keep complex domains understandable.
- **Production‑minded** – migrations, background processing, and observability; not just pretty frontends.
- **Clean architecture, not over‑engineering** – clear separation between routing, data, and UI, always in service of shipping.
- **User & dev friendly** – good UX for users and good DX for whoever maintains the code (often future‑me).

### Currently

- 🔭 Building: fullstack apps and starter templates with **TanStack Start + Bun + TypeScript**.
- 🧠 Refining: modern React patterns, React Compiler workflows, and how TanStack pieces fit together in real products.
- 🤖 Exploring: how AI can enhance both the user experience and the developer experience without taking over the whole app.
- ☕ Enjoying: strong coffee, good DX, and the occasional side‑project that my kids think is cooler than I do.
